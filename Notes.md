/// in previoues repo I make a mistake whiches I have to make the list array I dont do that I make it as astriong 
const [mission , SetMission] = useState ('') its wrong cuz I need to map to make a list 

// you can use ...mission in add data or genral way no need to Setmission(prevState) .... 

// to save the data you have to handel local storage in your app so when refresh every thing still store ...
